# BalloonGame

Jerry's Balloon Popping Game as seen on [Rick and Morty series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty). A 2D game implemented in Python.

## Getting Started

The goal of the game is to 'pop' as much balloons as possible without letting it hit the ceiling. A point is added each time a balloon is popped.

### Prerequisites

These libraries should be installed to run the game successfully (for now until compiled to an .exe file). Make sure Python3 is intalled by running:

* pygame
* numpy

##### In Terminal
```
python3 get-pip.py
pip3 install pygame
pip3 install numpy
```

### Installing

To install this repository to your local machine, you can use Git or download it directly as a .zip file above.

##### In Terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/markgacoka/BalloonGame
```

## Running the game
To run the one balloon game as a test, type this in the terminal:

```
python3 ~/pathtofile\one_balloon_working.py
```

To run the full game:
```
python3 ~/pathtofile\full_game_working.py
